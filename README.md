# Why I made this app
While studying at EDA, we learnt about incorporating external APIs into web applications. 
I thought it would be fun to make a simple web app using html, css, javaScript and React that calls the Free Online Dictionary API. 

# User Story 
A user can enter the English spelling of a word into the text box and received back the spelling in IPA.

Through refering the NZPA pronunication chart, the user can figure out how to pronounce a tricky word like choir. 

The user will also see the vowel shift in New Zealand English if the have prior knowledge of IPA.
