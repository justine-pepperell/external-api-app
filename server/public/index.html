<h2> What is phonetic spelling? </h2>
 
<p>
 Spelling is how we put words together, but what is phonetic spelling? 
 It's an alternate way to create words. Phonetic spelling is a system of spelling in which each letter represents one spoken sound. 
 In English, some words are pronounced exactly as they look. When B is used to spell ball, the letter B is assigned one sound.
 Unfortunately, just knowing the Englilsh alphabet isn't enough to be a proficient speller in English. For example, 
 pairing T with H creates a new sound: th-. The T takes on a new pronunciation. 
 Furthermore, there is a difference in how the th- sound can be pronounced, such as with this and thin. 
 So that single letter (T) does not correlate to only one pronunciation. In English, pronunciation follows rules that aren’t always obivious.
 There have been numerous attempts to simplify spelling in English, with entire books devoted to proposed alphabet systems that would simplify not only one language, 
 but apply universally to all (ask Google about Esperanto). Unfortunately it’s particularly difficult to reform the English language 
 due to the many and diverse languages it draws from. English isn't like JavaScript, the community can't get together every few years and update the language. 
 
 If you invest some time in learning the phonetic alphabet, you will be able to reach the phonetic spelling of words in dictionaries and figure out how to pronounce 
 tricky English words.
